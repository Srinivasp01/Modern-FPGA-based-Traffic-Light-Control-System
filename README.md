# Modern-FPGA-based-Traffic-Light-Control-System
 In this project we proposed a design of a modern FPGA-based Traffic Light Control (TLC) System to manage the road traffic. The approach is by controlling the access to areas shared among multiple intersections and allocating effective time between various users, during peak and off-peak hours.
